# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

Project Overview

This project is designed to enhance the shopping experience by providing users with an efficient and personalized e-commerce platform. It allows users to browse, purchase, and manage products seamlessly while enjoying a user-friendly interface.

Key Features
This project was built using MERN stack.
Then using Rest API and endpoints the user authentication was made for users to register and login,
and using the same, products were managed like updation and deletion.
Then for storing the product and the user data MongoDB was used.

Frontend: React framework for building the user interface.
Backend: Node.js to handle server-side operations and APIs.
Database: MongoDB for storing user and product data efficiently.
Why This Project

This project was developed to make online shopping easier and more enjoyable for users. By providing a personalized shopping experience, it helps users save time, find what they need, and stay updated with deals and notifications. The application aims to bring convenience and efficiency to e-commerce, catering to both frequent shoppers and occasional buyers.

**Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page**

Key Features

- Project Setup: Initialized the project with the required dependencies and folder structure.
- Login Page: A simple login page with fields for username and password.

Tech Stack Used

- Frontend: React, Tailwindcss

**Milestone 3: Server setup and error handling.**

Key Features:

Organized backend code with a clear folder structure.

Configured a Node.js server using Express to handle APIs.

Integrated MongoDB for data storage and management.

Implemented basic error handling for smooth server operations.

Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB, Mongoose


**Milestone:4**
# User Management System with File Upload

This project is a simple User Management System that allows the creation, retrieval, and management of user data. It also supports file uploads (like profile pictures) using *Multer*.

## Features
- *User Model*: Blueprint for storing user data in the database.
- *User Controller*: Manages operations like adding, retrieving, and updating user information.
- *File Uploads*: Accepts and stores user-uploaded files (e.g., profile images).
- *Documentation*: Well-documented code for ease of.


**Milestone:5**

This milestone focuses on setting up the project structure and implementing a basic signup page.


Key Features:

- Project Setup: Initialized the project with the required dependencies and folder structure.
- Signup Page: A simple signup page with fields for Name Email Password User Photo.

Tech Stack Used:

- Frontend: React


**Milestone 6: Password Encryption and User Data Storage**

Password Encryption: Used bcrypt to hash passwords.

User Data Storage: Saved user data securely in the database.

GitHub Updates: Committed changes for password encryption.

Tech stack used:
- nodejs

**Milestone 7:**
  In this milestone we are going to create a backend endpoint for user and  the focus is on validating user credentials and verifying the encrypted password stored in the database.



Key features:
1) validate user credentials during login:
Protect User Data: Keeps passwords safe even if the database is compromised.
Privacy: Ensures passwords aren't stored in plain text.
Compliance: Meets security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
Prevents Password Theft: Hashed passwords are difficult to decipher, increasing security.

2) compare the encrypted password with the user’s input:
User Enters Credentials:

The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.

Fetch User Data from Database:

The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username.
If the user is not found, return an error: "User does not exist."

Compare Encrypted Passwords:

Process the user's input password using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
Compare the resulting hash to the stored hashed password.
If they match, the user is authenticated; if not, send an error.

Tech stalk:
 Backend : bcryptjs.


**Milestone 8:**
In this milestone,  we will create a frontend card component for products and design a homepage to display these cards for each product.

Key features:
  1) create a card component:
Showcase Products Effectively: Presents product details in a clear and visually appealing way.
Reusable Design: Can be used across multiple pages or sections of the app.
Improved User Experience: Makes it easy for users to browse and interact with products.
Organized Layout: Keeps the homepage clean and structured.
  2) display those cards on the products page:
Create a Dynamic Component: Design a single card component that accepts product details as props.
Use Mapping: Use array mapping to iterate over the product list and render a card for each product.
Pass Data Dynamically: Pass unique product information (e.g., name, price, image) to each card.
Maintain Consistency: Ensure the layout remains uniform for all products.
