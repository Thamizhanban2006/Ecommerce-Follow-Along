**Tech Stack :**   
  1. Frontend        : React.js  
  2. Backend         : Node.js, Express.js  
  3. Database        : MongoDB  
  4. Authentication  : JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login  

**Introduction to MERN Stack :** You gained an understanding of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and its role in building full-stack web applications. The lesson highlighted the advantages of using JavaScript across both the frontend and backend, simplifying development.  

**Project Overview :** You were introduced to the goals and key features of the "Ecommerce-Follow-Along" project, which includes user authentication, product management, and order handling, all built with the MERN stack.

# Milestone 4 User Management System with File Upload

This project is a simple User Management System that allows the creation, retrieval, and management of user data. It also supports file uploads (like profile pictures) using *Multer*.

## Features
- *User Model*: Blueprint for storing user data in the database.
- *User Controller*: Manages operations like adding, retrieving, and updating user information.
- *File Uploads*: Accepts and stores user-uploaded files (e.g., profile images).
- *Documentation*: Well-documented code for ease of

Milestone 5: Project Signup Setup

This milestone focuses on setting up the project structure and implementing a basic signup page.

Key Features

- Project Setup: Initialized the project with the required dependencies and folder structure.
- Signup Page: A simple signup page with fields for Name Email Password User Photo.

Tech Stack Used

- Frontend: React

**Milestone 6:**
  This milestone focus on the password Encryption and User Data Storage

  Key Features

       1:Password Encryption: Used bcrypt to hash passwords.
       2:User Data Storage: Saved user data securely in the user inputs.

 Tech stack used :
   - Backend : node.js

   **Milestone 7:**
  In this milestone we are going to create a backend endpoint for user and  the focus is on validating user credentials and verifying the encrypted password stored in the database.



Key features:
   1) validate user credentials during login:
Protect User Data: Keeps passwords safe even if the database is compromised.
Privacy: Ensures passwords aren't stored in plain text.
Compliance: Meets security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
Prevents Password Theft: Hashed passwords are difficult to decipher, increasing security.

   2) compare the encrypted password with the user’s input:
User Enters Credentials:

The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.

Fetch User Data from Database:

The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username.
If the user is not found, return an error: "User does not exist."

Compare Encrypted Passwords:

Process the user's input password using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
Compare the resulting hash to the stored hashed password.
If they match, the user is authenticated; if not, send an error.

Tech stalk:
 Backend : bcryptjs.


**Milestone 8:**
In this milestone,  we will create a frontend card component for products and design a homepage to display these cards for each product.

Key features:
  1) create a card component:
Showcase Products Effectively: Presents product details in a clear and visually appealing way.
Reusable Design: Can be used across multiple pages or sections of the app.
Improved User Experience: Makes it easy for users to browse and interact with products.
Organized Layout: Keeps the homepage clean and structured.
  2) display those cards on the products page:
Create a Dynamic Component: Design a single card component that accepts product details as props.
Use Mapping: Use array mapping to iterate over the product list and render a card for each product.
Pass Data Dynamically: Pass unique product information (e.g., name, price, image) to each card.
Maintain Consistency: Ensure the layout remains uniform for all products.



Tech stack :
Frontend: react

**Milestone 9 - Product Input Form**
In this milestone, we built a frontend form to take product details as input, including multiple images. This form will allow users to add products, which will be saved in the database and displayed on the product page. This step is crucial in making the eCommerce platform functional. Future improvements can include admin access and shop profiles for better management. 

**Milestone 10 - Product Schema & API Endpoint**
In this milestone, we created a Mongoose schema to define the structure of product data, including fields like name, description, price, and image URL, with proper validation. We also built a POST endpoint to validate and store product details in MongoDB, ensuring data integrity. This step is essential for managing products efficiently in the eCommerce platform. 

**Milestone 11 - Dynamic Home Page with MongoDB Integration**

In this milestone, we focused on making the home page dynamic by fetching and displaying product data stored in MongoDB. The objective was to write a backend endpoint that retrieves all saved product data and sends it to the frontend. On the frontend, we implemented a function to request this data and dynamically render it using the previously created product card component. This milestone helped in understanding how to extract data from MongoDB, send it through an API endpoint, receive it in the frontend, and display it efficiently using components. By completing this, we have successfully built a dynamic product listing system that enhances user interaction and improves the functionality of our application.

**Milestone 12 - My Products Page with User-Based Filtering** 

In this milestone, we developed the **My Products** page, which displays only the products added by the logged-in user based on their email. We achieved this by writing a backend endpoint that filters product data in MongoDB using the user's email and sends only the relevant products to the frontend. On the frontend, we implemented a function to fetch this filtered data and dynamically render it using the existing product card component. This milestone provided valuable experience in filtering data based on specific constraints, handling API requests efficiently, and dynamically displaying user-specific content. Successfully completing this step enhances the personalization of the application, allowing users to manage their own products seamlessly. 

# Milestone 13: Edit Uploaded Products

## 🚀 Welcome to Milestone 13!
In this milestone, we have implemented the functionality to **edit uploaded products** in our application. This involves adding an **edit button**, pre-filling the form with existing data, and updating the product details in our **MongoDB database** via an API endpoint.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By completing this milestone, we have learned:
- How to write an **endpoint** to update existing data in **MongoDB**.
- How to **auto-fill a form** with previous product data and provide an option to edit.
- How to integrate the **frontend** and **backend** to perform update operations seamlessly.

---

## 🛠 Steps Implemented
### **1️⃣ Backend: Updating Product Details**
- Created a **PUT API endpoint** (`/products/:id`) to update existing product details.
- Used `findByIdAndUpdate()` method in **Mongoose** to modify product details.
- Handled errors properly for invalid or non-existent product IDs.

### **2️⃣ Frontend: Edit Button & Auto-Fill Form**
- Added an **edit button** on each product card.
- When clicked, it fetches existing product details and auto-fills the edit form.
- Allowed users to modify and update the details.
- Sent updated data to the backend to save changes.

### **3️⃣ Testing & Debugging**
- Tested the API endpoint using **Postman**.
- Verified that data updates correctly in **MongoDB**.
- Ensured the frontend reflects the updated product details in real-time.
